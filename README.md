BYU CS360 Web Application - Vicci Front End



Milestone 1
-----------

We have invested a significant amount of our time on design, architecture and user experience. We worked closely with Vicciâ€™s CEO and the rest of the non-technical Vicci team to gain an  understanding of the needs to be met.  After presenting our final design and wire frames to the Vicci team and incorporating their positive feedback, we submitted our designs to the professional designer that we have access to. 

While waiting for the designs, we have been individually going through Angular and Node tutorials.

Our final Interface Design can be seen on this [Prezi](http://prezi.com/ht31clpy510w/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy)
