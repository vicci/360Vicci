BYU CS360 Web Application - Vicci Front End
-------------------------------------------

###Idea, Features, and Architecture


**What:** Vicci Mobile Merchandise Client Web-Portal

Who will use this: Clients ranging from One Direction to the Seattle Seahawks

**Background:** Vicci is a mobile based tech start-up founded by BYU students. We empower live events to sell merchandise through their fan’s phones. We are launching our iOS and Android apps this December with the Donny and Marie Osmond tour where our apps will be used by fans to purchase merchandise from their phones rather than dealing with the hassle of buying it from a physical merch booth. 

**Project:** A web based Event and Merchandise management application. Currently, only someone with trained programming experience can input the Event and Merchandise data required for the apps to run. We want to create a web app in order to make it so simple that Taylor Swift herself can do it. This application will allow our clients to login and easily create and manage the merchandise they want Vicci to sell at their events.

###Milestone 1

We have invested a significant amount of our time on design, architecture and user experience. We worked closely with Vicci’s CEO and the rest of the non-technical Vicci team to gain an  understanding of the needs to be met.  After presenting our final design and wire frames to the Vicci team and incorporating their positive feedback, we submitted our designs to the professional designer that we have access to. 

While waiting for the designs, we have been individually going through Angular and Node tutorials.

Our final Interface Design can be seen on this [Prezi](http://prezi.com/ht31clpy510w/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy)
